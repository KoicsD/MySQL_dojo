# Welcome to my MySQL-dojo tasks!

Coding-dojo means doing some exercises in order to maintain your skills of coding.  
Now, on Spring of 2016 our dojo-tasks at [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/) are about [*MySQL*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL).
This repository is the collection of these tasks.

Thank you for following my work! :)
